# Sample Responsive Portfolio

### Demo
This site can be accessed [here.](https://msyphus.github.io/responsive-portfolio)

### General
This is a responsive sample portfolio built from scratch without using a framework.  Adjustments to page styling occur at screen widths of 980px, 768px, and 640px in order to accommodate large, medium, and small screens.

The purpose of this site is to demonstrate responsive design, not serve as an actual portfolio.  Therefore, the contact form does not submit information anywhere, portfolio project images are just randomized placeholders, and projects are not necessarily real.

### Technical Information
Technologies used to create this site include:
* HTML
* CSS
* [loremflickr.com](https://www.loremflickr.com) for placeholder images

This site was created by Mark Syphus, 2020.
