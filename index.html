            <p>I'm a second-generation programmer.  My dad introduced me
            to programming when I was a child.  He taught me QBasic
            (shows you my age) and I felt really smart when I showed
            my friends I could draw silly pictures on the computer
            using code.  My friends were impressed, so I started
            teaching them, too.  Fast forward and one of those friends
            was so interested in programming that he got a degree in 
            software engineering and became a programmer.  Although
            I enjoyed coding I, for some reason, chose to become a
                scientist.

            <p>I had a successful career in the aquaculture feed industry
            formulating diets for all kinds of aquatic animals (and 
            even some dogs and reptiles), overseeing quality assurance
            and quality control, and leading R&D projects.  Being in
                aquaculture requires living in exotic places, which was
                not a problem until having my first child.  Eventually,
                things just weren't going well for the family, so I'm 
                switching careers into programming.
