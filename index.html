            <p>I'm a second-generation programmer.  My dad introduced me
            to programming when I was a child.  Showing my friends that I
            could draw silly pictures and add music to them with code always
            made me feel smart.  Some of my friends were impressed, so I started
            teaching them, too.  Fast forward and one of those friends
            was so interested in programming that he got a degree in 
            software engineering and became a programmer.  Although
            I enjoyed coding I, chose to become a scientist.
            </p>
        
            <p>I had a successful career in the aquaculture feed industry
            formulating diets for all kinds of aquatic animals (and 
            even some dogs and reptiles), overseeing quality assurance
            and quality control, and leading R&D projects.  My work frequently
            led to using coding (R for statistics, VBA for work documents) or
            working with the IT Department to improve the user experience of
            the software applications we were using (ERP, MES, CRM, Business 
            Intelligence, databases, and formulation software).  Eventually, I
            realized that my favorite days at work were the days when I was coding
            or working with improving software solutions.  Therefore, I'm making
            the switch to become a full stack developer.
